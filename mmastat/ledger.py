"""Forward odds capture: the only remaining way to test the residual rule.

The problem this solves. Every result in this project is retrospective, and the
one finding that ever pointed the right way — the market-residual model,
better in 6 of 6 walk-forward folds — cannot be confirmed retrospectively. The
252-fight holdout has no prices. Re-scoring old fights against old odds is
re-reading data the rule was built on. The only honest test is to write the
prediction down before the fight and check it afterwards.

So this is an append-only log. Three commands:

    capture   fetch live lines, compute the frozen rule's number, append a row
    settle    match logged rows to finished fights, record the outcome
    report    bets, ROI, CLV, and progress toward the 300-bet threshold

Three rules that keep it honest, all enforced in code rather than by intention:

  FROZEN COEFFICIENTS. The rule's weights live in residual_model.json and are
  applied, never refitted. Refitting on each capture would quietly turn the
  forward test back into a retrospective one.

  APPEND ONLY. Rows are never rewritten, only settled. A ledger you can edit
  is a ledger you will edit.

  CLOSING LINE = LAST SNAPSHOT. Capture runs repeatedly; the row nearest the
  event is the closing price. Closing line value converges far faster than ROI
  (~300 bets for ROI, a few dozen for CLV), so CLV is the metric that will
  tell you something first.
