"""Turn an upcoming fight card into predictions.

On retrieval. There is no reliable free machine-readable feed of upcoming UFC
cards. UFCStats' own upcoming page sits behind a JavaScript interstitial (a
plain request returns "Checking your browser..."), the Kaggle `upcoming.csv`
turned out to be a frozen snapshot months out of date, and every other listing
is a news site whose HTML changes without notice. A scraper built on any of
those is a thing that breaks silently and leaves you showing stale fights.

So the input here is a plain text file you edit by hand, `data/upcoming.txt`:

    # UFC 331 | 2026-09-19 | Crypto.com Arena, Los Angeles
    Joshua Van vs. Alexandre Pantoja
    Arman Tsarukyan vs. Mauricio Ruffy
    ...

Thirteen lines copied off any fight card takes a minute, needs no terminal, and
cannot break. `fetch_ufcstats_upcoming()` is provided for when you want to
automate it, but it is unverified from this environment and the manual path is
the one that will still work next year.

Name resolution is the real problem, not retrieval. Newcomers have no history
(Patricio Pitbull's UFC debut has no UFCStats record however famous he is), and
spellings drift between sources. Unresolved and insufficient-history fighters
are reported explicitly rather than silently defaulted to league averages,
because a confident-looking 50/50 on a debut is worse than saying "no read".
