"""Conditional base rates: what happened in past fights that looked like this.

Not a model. Counts. For each registered condition the corpus is split into
quartiles and the outcome rate is reported with n and a 95% interval.

The condition list is FIXED in PREREGISTRATION.md addendum 10 and every entry
is rendered every time, including the ones that come out flat. The risk this
guards against is not false discovery, it is selective display: with a dozen
candidate conditions, showing whichever looks strongest turns a lookup table
into a machine for rendering noise attractively. C5 (combined control share
against inside-the-distance) measured flat and stays in the panel for exactly
that reason — a display that only ever shows strong relationships is
indistinguishable from one that selects them.

Two granularities, because the outcomes live at different levels:
  fighter  one row per fighter per fight  (did HE land a takedown)
  fight    one row per fight              (did IT end inside the distance)
