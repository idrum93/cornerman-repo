"""Automated data refresh: results backfill and upcoming cards.

## Why not fetch_ufcstats_upcoming()

It is kept below, but it is the fallback, not the answer, and the reason is
specifically about automation. The only scheduler you can run without a
terminal is GitHub Actions, and Actions runs on datacenter IPs — which is
exactly what triggered UFCStats' "Checking your browser" interstitial when it
was tested. So a cron job calling UFCStats would fail in precisely the
environment it needs to run in. Use it only from a residential connection.

## What to use instead

Two sources, chosen because neither blocks datacenter traffic:

  RESULTS      raw.githubusercontent.com — the Greco1899 CSVs are plain files
               in a public repo. Re-downloading them is the entire backfill.
               No scraping, no parsing, nothing to break.

  UPCOMING     the MediaWiki API on en.wikipedia.org. It is a documented JSON
               interface that explicitly welcomes automated clients, has no
               bot-check, and is where UFC card data is reliably maintained.

## Failure policy

Every fetch here validates before it writes, and raises instead of returning
something plausible-but-wrong. A stale card shown confidently is worse than a
visible error: the whole point of automating this is that nobody is watching.
`refresh_upcoming()` will not overwrite a good file with a worse one.
