"""Live moneyline prices from The Odds API, for the automated refresh.

Why this and not the Kaggle feed: that file has no public raw URL, so a CI job
cannot fetch it. The Odds API has a perpetual free tier (500 requests/month;
one call a day uses about 30), returns JSON over a plain URL, and covers MMA.

What it does NOT provide, and nobody free does: **method, round or any other
prop prices for MMA.** The Odds API's own documentation says it covers fight
winner odds only. So the site prices its own props from the hazard model and
shows a market marker on the moneyline alone. That asymmetry is honest — a
model number and a market number side by side is a comparison; a model number
alone is a projection, and the site should not imply otherwise.

Set ODDS_API_KEY in the environment. In GitHub Actions:
Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret.
Absent key means absent panel, never a stale price.
