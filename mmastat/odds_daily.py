"""The jerzyszocik daily-snapshot odds feed.

This file is two datasets in one, and treating it as one thing produces
nonsense. Splitting them is the first thing this module does.

REGIME A  source == "zewnetrzne", 2010-2024, 6,299 fights, one row each.
          Carries the UFCStats fight-details hash (100%), so it joins to the
          corpus directly with no name matching, and 99% of those hashes are
          present in our corpus. 4,867 fights carry a COMPLETE six-leg
          method-of-victory market (each fighter by KO / submission /
          decision), which is the only prop-price source found anywhere free.
          It is a single price of unknown timing — all rows were stamped in one
          bulk import on 2025-07-27 — so it cannot be called a closing line.

REGIME B  37 live bookmakers, 2025-03-08 onward, 1,778 bouts, ~202k rows.
          Real repeated snapshots: 79% of bouts have 2+ and 41% have 5+, with a
          median of 7 books quoting each bout. No fight hash after 2025 (0% in
          2026), so it joins by normalized name plus event date, which reaches
          64% of corpus fights.

TIMING, which decides what this feed may be used for. The last snapshot before
an event lands a median of 27 hours out, with the 25th percentile at 7 hours.
That is a Friday price for a Saturday card, NOT a closing line. A pre-close
price is a less efficient market, so scoring a model against it flatters the
model — the bias runs toward whatever you are hoping to prove. Use it for
description and for line-movement work; do not substitute it for the
prospective capture the pre-registration requires.

Regime B also contains non-UFC promotions (the feed is "UFC/MMA" and the
source is Polish, so KSW bouts appear). Joining to the corpus filters them.
