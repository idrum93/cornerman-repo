# Pre-registration: style-matchup interactions

**Written before any of these were fitted. Committed on 2026-09-17.**

The purpose of this file is to make it impossible to fool ourselves later. With
~7,000 usable fights and a few dozen candidate interactions, testing them all
and reporting the winners would guarantee a "finding" whether or not one exists.
Twenty independent tests at p<0.05 produce one false positive by construction.
That is exactly how people come to believe southpaws have an edge over
wrestlers.

So: the hypotheses below are fixed in advance, with directions stated. Anything
not on this list is exploratory and must be labelled as such wherever it
appears, including in the UI.

## Holdout

**252 fights, 2026-04-04 to 2026-09-12.** These sit after the betting-odds file
ends, have never been used for fitting, tuning, feature selection, or any
decision in this project. They are spent once. Do not look at them until the
confirmatory tests below are specified and the model is frozen.

Primary fitting/validation uses fights from 2012-01-01 to 2026-03-28.

## Multiplicity correction

Nine hypotheses. Benjamini-Hochberg at FDR 0.10 across the whole family. A
hypothesis counts as supported only if it survives correction AND the effect
has the pre-stated sign AND it replicates on the holdout.

## Hypotheses

Each is a single interaction term added to the frozen 14-feature win model. The
test is on the interaction coefficient, not on model accuracy.

| # | interaction | predicted sign | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | leg_share x opponent stance mismatch | positive | open stance exposes the lead leg |
| H2 | leg_share x opponent td_def | positive | kicking is riskier against a wrestler who can catch it |
| H3 | (clinch_share + ground_share) x opponent td_def | negative | position-dependent offense needs the takedown to land |
| H4 | body_share x opponent late-round output decay | positive | body work is the classic pace-breaker |
| H5 | kd15 x opponent kd_against15 | positive | power vs chin, already in as `power_edge` |
| H6 | reach differential x own dist_share | positive | reach should pay off only for fighters who fight at range |
| H7 | reach differential x opponent clinch_share | negative | a clinch fighter neutralises reach |
| H8 | td15 x opponent ground_share | negative | taking down a dangerous bottom player is a poor plan |
| H9 | age differential x own pace (ss_att per min) | negative | high-output styles should age worse |

## Pre-stated expectations

Most of these will fail. H5 is already in the model as `power_edge` and carried
a small positive coefficient (+0.09), so it is the most likely to survive. H6
and H7 are the most interesting if true, because reach currently enters the
model as a flat effect and it almost certainly is not one.

Note the prior: adding eight style features to the win model produced a log
loss change of **-0.0009, 95% CI [-0.0041, +0.0022], P(better) = 0.293** — no
detectable effect. Style data did not help predict *who wins*. These
interactions are a more targeted second attempt, and the honest base rate for
that kind of second attempt is low.

## What a null result means

That the style data belongs in the projections and the explanation panel, where
it already demonstrably works (strike-volume ranking Spearman 0.441 vs 0.283 for
a career average; takedown-probability AUC 0.742), and not in the win
probability. That is a perfectly good outcome and must be reported as clearly
as a positive one.

## Prohibited

- Adding hypotheses after seeing results, then presenting them as confirmatory
- Reporting the best of several specifications of the same hypothesis
- Re-using the 252-fight holdout after a failed test
- Dropping a hypothesis from the family to improve the correction for others
- Any "directionally encouraging" language for a result that failed correction

---

# Addendum: market-residual hypotheses

**Added 2026-09-17, after the residual model was fitted but before any of the
rules below were tested on data that could confirm them.**

## What was found

`residual.py` puts `logit(p_market)` in as a fixed offset, so each coefficient
answers "given the price, what does this feature still tell you?". Fitted on
2012 to 2024, walk-forward validated over six disjoint test blocks:

- Log loss beat the closing line in **6 of 6 folds** (sign test p ≈ 0.03).
  Pooled over 2,034 fights: 0.6080 vs 0.6114, gain **+0.0035, 95% CI
  [-0.0010, +0.0079], P(better) = 0.934**. Consistent direction; the interval
  still crosses zero.
- Eight of 22 coefficients had bootstrap CIs excluding zero — but that
  bootstrap is **in-sample**, on the training data, and the features are
  correlated. It does not establish out-of-sample edge.
- Flat-staking at every edge threshold gave positive ROI. Best single cut:
  favourites with >2% edge, n=484, **+7.20%, t = +2.13**. That is one of
  roughly twelve cuts examined, so uncorrected it is p≈0.03 and Bonferroni-
  corrected it is not significant.

The coefficients tell a coherent story, which is why this is worth pursuing
rather than dismissing. The market appears to **overreact to narrative
qualities and underreact to boring ones**:

| feature | beta given the market | reading |
|---|---|---|
| d_age | −0.158 | the line under-penalises age |
| d_sapm | −0.147 | under-penalises getting hit |
| d_kd15 | −0.123 | **over**-values knockdown power |
| d_log_exp | +0.098 | over-penalises veteran status |
| d_log_layoff | +0.068 | over-penalises ring rust |

## The frozen rule

Committed now, no further tuning permitted:

    features : d_age, d_sapm, d_kd15, d_log_exp, d_log_layoff
    model    : OffsetLogit(l2=25.0), offset = logit(devigged closing prob)
    scaler   : StandardScaler fitted on the training window only
    bet when : model_prob - vig_inclusive_implied_prob > 0.02
               AND vig_inclusive_implied_prob >= 0.50   (favourites only)
    stake    : flat, 1 unit
    success  : ROI > +2% over >=300 bets

## Why this cannot be tested on the reserved holdout

The 252-fight holdout (2026-04-04 to 2026-09-12) has **no odds** — the Kaggle
odds file stops at 2026-03-28. A market-edge hypothesis cannot be tested
without prices, so that holdout is useless for this particular question and
remains reserved for the style-interaction hypotheses above.

**The only valid test is forward paper-trading.** Record the closing line and
the model's probability for every fight before it happens, then evaluate after
300+ bets. Anything else is re-reading data the rule was built on.

## Expected outcome

Low. An apparent +7% ROI on a retrospective subset of a liquid market is far
more often multiple comparisons than edge, and the effect is concentrated in
exactly the price band where the [favourite-longshot analysis](#) showed the
market is already at break-even. Record the result either way.

## Additional prohibitions for this addendum

- No re-tuning of the threshold, the l2, or the feature list after seeing
  forward results. A changed rule is a new hypothesis with a fresh sample.
- No reporting of ROI on fewer than 300 bets.
- No switching to closing-line-value as the success metric after an ROI
  failure, or vice versa.
- Underdogs are excluded by the rule and stay excluded; their subset returned
  −1.90% and adding them back after the fact would be selection.

# Addendum 3: round-shape hypotheses (2026-09-18)

Registered before fitting. The round-by-round data has been in
`ufc_fight_stats.csv` all along — the loader aggregates it to fight totals and
throws the trajectory away. One summary of that trajectory (round 3 output
divided by round 1) was already tested and was null, so these are a second
attempt at the same underlying idea and the prior is correspondingly low.

Registering them matters here specifically because there are dozens of ways to
summarise a three-point curve. Fitting several and reporting the best is how a
null becomes a "finding".

| # | feature | predicted sign | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | first-round output relative to own career R1 rate | positive | fast starters vs slow starters is a real stylistic split |
| R2 | round-to-round variance of significant-strike rate | negative | erratic output implies inconsistency, not adaptability |
| R3 | late-round striking ACCURACY change (R3+ minus R1) | positive | accuracy decay should track fatigue better than volume, which is confounded by the opponent going into a shell |
| R4 | control-time share in R1 vs R3+ | positive | wrestlers who keep controlling late are the ones whose grappling actually holds |
| R5 | opponent's output decay when facing this fighter, career average | positive | a pressure fighter who drags others down is different from one who merely paces himself |

R3 and R5 are the interesting ones. Volume decay failed, and both of these
test whether a better-chosen summary of the same curve carries what volume did
not. R5 in particular is a defensive-pressure measure with no equivalent
anywhere in the current feature set.

Family of five, Benjamini-Hochberg at FDR 0.10, evaluated on the 2012-2026-03
window with the 252-fight holdout still reserved.

## Why the uploaded parquet files are NOT being used

`full_data_silver_plus.parquet` is the same round-level data already present in
`ufc_fight_stats.csv`, reshaped wide. Nothing new.

It also carries `f_1_fighter_SlpM`, `f_1_fighter_Str_Def`, `f_1_fighter_TD_Def`
and similar. Those are **career-aggregate values scraped from the fighter's
current UFCStats profile**, so on a 2015 fight row they describe a career that
includes fights through 2026. Using them as features is textbook temporal
leakage, and it is silent. Anyone building on that dataset should be told.

`ufc_features.parquet` is ~12,000 engineered columns: rolling win/loss/finish/
streak counts over windows of 3 through 10 previous fights, plus `f_1_ranking`
and `f_2_ranking`. Every one of those rolling features is something
`features.walk()` already computes under a tested no-leakage guarantee. Adopting
thousands of unverified equivalents would trade the single property that makes
this project trustworthy for convenience.

Rankings are the one genuinely new item. If pursued, the first check is whether
the rank is as-of-fight-date or the fighter's current rank — the latter is the
same leakage class as above, and `test_no_leakage` would not catch it because
the value arrives pre-computed from outside the walk.

---

# Addendum 4: the fortitude cluster (2026-09-18)

**Written after the features were built and the pipeline validated, before any
model was fitted to them.**

The idea: durability late in a fight may be a dimension markets underweight,
because it is invisible in the headline stats everyone quotes. Volume decay was
already tested alone and was null; this treats late-round resilience as a
cluster rather than a single ratio.

All six are career-to-date, accumulated inside `features.walk()`, and shrink
toward the NULL rather than toward a league mean — a fighter with two deep
rounds on record looks exactly average, which is what you want when the
quantity is a deviation. Round 1 versus rounds 3+; round 2 is excluded from both
sides as transitional.

| # | feature | predicted sign | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | `d_late_acc_delta` | positive | accuracy in rounds 3+ minus round 1. Cleaner than volume: an opponent retreating into a shell looks identical to a fighter tiring, but accuracy is not confounded that way |
| F2 | `d_late_volume_ret` | positive | output retention. Included despite the earlier null so the cluster is complete and the earlier result is re-tested under correction |
| F3 | `d_ctrl_retention` | positive | grapplers who still control late are the ones whose wrestling is real rather than a first-round burst |
| F4 | `d_induced_decay` | **negative** | how much this fighter's OPPONENTS fade. Below 1.0 means people wilt against him. Distinct from pacing himself, and has no equivalent anywhere in the feature set |
| F5 | `d_deep_experience` | positive | career rounds logged past round 2 — "championship rounds" experience, which commentary treats as real and which no stat page reports |
| F6 | `d_kd_recovery` | positive | share of knockdowns absorbed that did not end the fight. Heavily shrunk; most fighters have almost no sample |

## Analysis plan, fixed now

- Window 2012-01-01 to 2026-03-28. The 252-fight holdout stays reserved.
- Each feature added **individually** to the frozen 14-feature win model;
  coefficient sign and bootstrap CI recorded.
- The whole cluster added together, log-loss change bootstrapped against the
  frozen model.
- **Benjamini-Hochberg at FDR 0.10 across all six.** A feature counts only if
  it survives correction AND carries the predicted sign.
- Separately, the cluster is tested on the market residual (`residual.py`),
  since "markets underweight this" is the actual claim and it is a different
  test from "it predicts outcomes".

## Pre-stated expectation

Low, and the reason is specific. Every prior attempt to add information beyond
the core 14 has come back null: style features (−0.0009), margin-aware rating,
pace decay, clustering. Aggregate round-1 accuracy is 0.462 and late accuracy
0.458 — there is no league-wide fade for individual variation to sit inside.

F4 is the one worth watching. It measures something about the opponent rather
than the fighter, which is the only structurally new kind of information in
the cluster.

## Prohibited

- Reporting individual features that fail BH correction as "directionally
  encouraging"
- Dropping F2 or F6 from the family to improve the correction for the others
- Re-specifying a feature (different round split, different shrinkage) and
  re-testing without declaring it a new hypothesis

## Addendum 4: RESULT (2026-09-18)

**Zero of six supported.** Nothing survives Benjamini-Hochberg, and five of the
six carry the *wrong* sign.

| feature | predicted | beta | 95% CI | p | BH threshold | sign correct |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `d_kd_recovery` | + | -0.0683 | [-0.143, -0.003] | .045 | .0167 | no |
| `d_late_volume_ret` | + | -0.0487 | [-0.100, +0.007] | .090 | .0333 | no |
| `d_deep_experience` | + | +0.0962 | [-0.017, +0.195] | .105 | .0500 | **yes** |
| `d_ctrl_retention` | + | -0.0439 | [-0.096, +0.015] | .115 | .0667 | no |
| `d_late_acc_delta` | + | -0.0260 | [-0.081, +0.023] | .245 | .0833 | no |
| `d_induced_decay` | - | +0.0277 | [-0.020, +0.079] | .335 | .1000 | no |

Whole cluster added to the frozen model: accuracy **67.42% vs 67.54%**, log loss
**0.6215 vs 0.6199**, gain **-0.0016, 95% CI [-0.0052, +0.0019], P(better) =
0.185**. It makes the model slightly worse.

`d_deep_experience` is the only one with the predicted sign and it does not
clear its threshold (p = .105 against .050). Per the prohibitions above it is
not reported as encouraging, and note its uncorrected p-value would not have
survived either.

`d_kd_recovery` is nominally the strongest and points the *wrong way* — fighters
who have survived knockdowns do slightly worse, not better. That is more
consistent with "having been knocked down is bad news about your chin" than
with recovery being evidence of toughness, and it aligns with `d_ko_loss_rate`
already carrying a negative weight in the frozen model.

**Conclusion: fortitude, as measurable from round-level UFCStats data, does not
predict who wins.** The earlier pace-decay null was not a bad choice of
summary; the underlying dimension appears to be absent. Aggregate round-1
accuracy is 0.462 and late accuracy 0.458, so there was little league-wide fade
for individual variation to live inside.

The features stay in the codebase and out of `WIN_FEATURES`. They are
legitimate descriptive content for the site — "his opponents' output drops 12%
after round two" is a real, checkable sentence about a fighter — but they are
not predictive.

The market-residual half of this plan was not run. With the cluster failing to
predict outcomes at all, testing whether markets underprice it would be testing
whether they underprice noise.

# Addendum 6: competing-risks hazard model (2026-09-18)

Built as the one remaining principled structure: a fight ending is a race
between four hazards (each fighter by KO or submission) against the clock, so
one fit should produce method, round and winner coherently instead of three
classifiers that can contradict each other.

**It works structurally and does not beat what it replaced.**

| | coherent hazard | independent classifiers | market |
|---|---|---|---|
| KO/TKO AUC | .6617 | **.6686** | — |
| submission AUC | **.6625** | .6477 | — |
| decision AUC | .6077 | **.6234** | — |
| KO/TKO Brier (market subset) | **.1873** | — | .1922 |
| submission Brier (market subset) | .1319 | — | **.1216** |
| decision Brier (market subset) | .2533 | — | **.2363** |

Who wins: hazard roll-up 65.02% / .7073 AUC versus the direct logistic at
66.01% / .7153. Averaging the two is marginally the best of the three
(66.26%, .7164, log loss .6206), which is a genuine if small ensemble gain.

Calibration after fitting two hazard multipliers on a validation slice:
P(decision) .487 vs .525 actual, P(KO) .307 vs .303, P(sub) .205 vs .172.

**What it buys, which the metrics do not show.** The independent classifiers
sum to a mean of 0.9619 with a range of 0.584 to 1.313 — some fights get a
method distribution summing to 131%. The hazard model sums to 1.000000 by
construction, and produces P(ends in round N) and expected duration as
by-products of the same curve. For a site that displays these numbers, internal
consistency is worth more than a thousandth of Brier.

**A bug worth recording.** The first version rolled the survival curve over
each fight's OBSERVED duration rather than its SCHEDULED duration. A
first-round knockout then had one interval to decay over and came out as the
likeliest decision on the card: P(decision) scored **AUC 0.19**, reliably
backwards. It is the survival analogue of temporal leakage — using the outcome
to decide how far to integrate — and `test_no_leakage` would not catch it
because it lives in the prediction step, not the feature build. `expand()` now
takes an explicit `full` flag with the distinction documented at the call site.

**Conclusion.** Adopt it for the product, not for accuracy. It replaces
`props.py` as the source of method and round numbers on the site because those
numbers will be coherent. The win probability stays with the direct logistic,
or the average of the two if the small ensemble gain holds up on more data.

# Addendum 7: weight audit and two ablations (2026-09-19)

Prompted by a reasonable question — why does strength of schedule carry so
much weight?

## What the weights actually are

Drop-one ablation on the held-out block. `drop_ll > 0` means removing the
feature makes the model worse.

| feature | beta | 95% CI | drop_ll | drop_acc |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| d_age | -0.389 | [-0.45,-0.33] | +0.0178 | **-3.98** |
| d_adj_slpm | +0.242 | [+0.11,+0.37] | +0.0009 | -0.72 |
| d_sapm | -0.196 | [-0.26,-0.13] | +0.0062 | -0.24 |
| d_ko_loss_rate | -0.192 | [-0.36,-0.03] | +0.0001 | +0.36 |
| d_elo | +0.191 | [+0.11,+0.25] | +0.0055 | -1.69 |
| **d_opp_elo** | **+0.167** | [+0.11,+0.22] | **+0.0058** | **-1.09** |
| d_str_def | +0.156 | [+0.10,+0.22] | -0.0009 | -0.24 |
| grapple_edge | +0.149 | [+0.10,+0.21] | +0.0033 | -1.45 |
| ko_edge | -0.126 | [-0.31,+0.07] | 0.0000 | 0.00 |
| d_reach | +0.109 | [+0.06,+0.16] | -0.0003 | 0.00 |
| d_str_acc | +0.086 | [+0.04,+0.14] | +0.0010 | -0.48 |
| d_log_exp | -0.075 | [-0.14,-0.02] | +0.0027 | -0.84 |
| d_log_layoff | +0.031 | [-0.02,+0.09] | -0.0013 | 0.00 |
| sub_edge | -0.011 | [-0.06,+0.04] | -0.0002 | -0.12 |

**Strength of schedule is legitimate.** It correlates only **0.133** with Elo —
Elo measures how well you have done, `d_opp_elo` measures who you did it
against, and a fighter can post a strong record against weak opposition.
Dropping it costs 1.09 accuracy points, third worst of the fourteen.

Age remains dominant: removing it costs **4 accuracy points**, more than four
times any other feature.

## Ablation 1: pruning. FAILED, and the failure is the lesson.

Four features have CIs crossing zero and ablations suggesting they are dead
weight. Dropping ko_edge, d_log_layoff and sub_edge scored better on the test
block on all three metrics — 67.55% vs 67.31%, log loss 0.6194 vs 0.6208.

**That was test-set overfitting.** The features were chosen by looking at the
test block. Re-run honestly — backward elimination judged only on a validation
slice, then confirmed once on test — validation selected a *different* trio
(dropping `d_sapm` instead of `ko_edge`) and the result reversed: log loss
**-0.0044, 95% CI [-0.0090, +0.0002], P(better) = 0.032**, i.e. almost
certainly worse.

Two conclusions. The 14 features stay exactly as they are. And at ~3,300
training fights, feature selection does not generalise — the sample cannot
distinguish a dead feature from a quiet one.

## Ablation 2: recency weighting. NULL.

The state accumulators weight a 2014 fight identically to a 2026 one, which
was listed as a known gap. Tested by decaying every accumulator by
exp(-lambda x years) at each update and exposing the decayed rates as extra
differentials.

Half-life chosen on validation (which picked 3.0 years), confirmed on test:
gain **+0.0000, 95% CI [-0.0052, +0.0046], P(better) = 0.518**. Accuracy fell
slightly, AUC rose slightly. Nothing.

Note the shorter half-lives were *negative* on validation (-0.0019 at 9 months,
-0.0010 at 1 year). Recent form carries no information the career average
lacks, and weighting it harder actively hurts. The shrinkage already in
`state.py` appears to be doing this job.

## Addendum 1: RESULT (2026-09-19)

**Zero of nine supported.** Smallest p-value was 0.060 against a BH threshold
of 0.011, and six of the nine carried the wrong sign.

| hypothesis | predicted | beta | p | sign ok |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 leg-kicks x stance mismatch | + | -0.0513 | .060 | no |
| H5 power x chin | + | +0.0395 | .147 | yes |
| H4 body work x opponent decay | + | -0.0393 | .213 | no |
| H3 clinch/ground x takedown defence | - | -0.0345 | .293 | yes |
| H8 takedowns x opponent ground game | - | +0.0282 | .353 | no |
| H7 reach x opponent clinch share | - | +0.0789 | .400 | no |
| H6 reach x own distance share | + | -0.1495 | .513 | no |
| H2 leg-kicks x takedown defence | + | +0.0037 | .853 | yes |
| H9 age x pace | - | +0.0150 | .987 | no |

H6 and H7 were named in advance as the most interesting — reach entering the
model as a flat effect "almost certainly isn't one". Both came back with the
wrong sign and p > 0.4. **Reach is a flat effect.** That is a real answer to a
reasonable question, arrived at the only way it could be.

# Addendum 8: five angles from fields already in the corpus (2026-09-19)

Registered before fitting. These are not new formulas over existing features —
that avenue is exhausted — but **measurements never extracted**, all from
columns already downloaded and currently unused.

| # | measurement | source | predicted sign | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | small-cage venue (UFC Apex, Las Vegas) x own pressure style | `LOCATION` | positive for pressure fighters | the Apex cage is 25ft against the standard 30ft; less room to circle should favour forward pressure and raise finish rates |
| V2 | altitude of venue x own cardio proxy | `LOCATION` + lookup (Denver, Mexico City, Salt Lake, Calgary) | negative for high-output fighters | thin air punishes pace; only 21 events, so power is low and a null is uninformative |
| V3 | referee identity x fight duration and method | `REFEREE`, 249 distinct, 99.7% populated | referees with early-stoppage tendencies raise P(KO/TKO) | a genuinely unacknowledged input: the third person in the cage decides when a fight ends |
| V4 | moving up or down a weight class | `WEIGHTCLASS` history per fighter | negative for moving up | a real and widely discussed effect that appears in no stat line |
| V5 | career mileage: cumulative minutes fought and strikes absorbed | existing accumulators | negative | wear distinct from age — two 34-year-olds with 20 and 60 career rounds are not the same fighter |

V3 and V5 are the ones worth watching. V3 because referee assignment is
knowable before a fight and is plausibly priced by nobody, and it targets the
**method and round props** rather than the winner — which is where a coherent
hazard model could actually use it. V5 because age is the single strongest
feature in the model and mileage is the mechanism people assume is behind it;
if mileage carries signal beyond age, that is a genuine decomposition.

Family of five, Benjamini-Hochberg at FDR 0.10. Winner hypotheses tested on
the 2012 to 2026-03 window; V3 tested against method rather than outcome. The
252-fight holdout stays reserved.

**Prior: low, as always.** Every previous family has come back null. V2 is
underpowered by construction and is included for completeness, not hope.

## Addendum 8: RESULT (2026-09-19)

**Zero of five supported.** BH thresholds run 0.025 to 0.100; the smallest
p-value was 0.140.

| # | measurement | predicted | beta | p | sign ok |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| V5 | career mileage | - | -0.3241 | .140 | **yes** |
| V4 | weight-class move | - | +0.0246 | .393 | no |
| V1 | Apex cage x pressure | + | +0.0144 | .567 | yes |
| V2 | altitude x pace | - | +0.0116 | .593 | no |

**V3, referee stoppage tendency → P(KO/TKO): AUC 0.523** on 1,084 fights.
Referees' career KO rates genuinely range from 0.160 to 0.437, a wide spread —
but it does not transfer to the next fight. Either the spread is the fighters
they happen to be assigned rather than the referee, or stoppage style matters
less than the difference between a durable and a fragile chin. This was the
most promising of the five and it is a clean null.

V5 is the near-miss: correct sign, largest coefficient in the family, p = 0.14.
Mileage may carry a little signal beyond age, but not at this sample size, and
per the standing prohibitions it is not reported as encouraging. If anything is
revisited later it should be this one, with a cleaner mileage measure (true
career rounds rather than the `log_exp` proxy used here).

## Standing conclusion after eight families

Tested and null: style shares, margin-aware ratings, cardio, fight-type
clustering, the fortitude cluster, nine style interactions, Bradley-Terry,
Pythagorean/log5, recency weighting, feature pruning, and now venue, altitude,
referee, weight-class moves and mileage.

**Nothing has beaten the 14 features.** The one result that has ever pointed
the right way consistently is the market-residual model (6 of 6 folds,
P(better) = 0.934), which remains unconfirmed and untestable without forward
odds capture. The binding constraint is not ideas — it is ~6.5 recorded fights
per athlete and one bit of outcome per fight.

# Addendum 9: the distance market (2026-09-20)

**Registered before any Polymarket price has been seen.** The fetcher is built
and classifies distance markets, but has not yet been run against live data.
Writing the rule after seeing the first quotes would make this retrospective,
and the whole point of the venue is that it is a fresh test.

## Why this market and not the others

Method props are closed — the market beat us on all three at P(model better)
= 0.000, by a wider margin than on the moneyline. Distance is different in
three ways: it is two-way rather than six-way, so the margin is far smaller;
the competing-risks model prices it directly and coherently; and on Polymarket
the cost is a one- or two-cent spread rather than a bookmaker's overround.

## A correction that had to come first

The raw hazard roll-up predicted P(decision) = 0.487 against an actual 0.525.
That is not miscalibration — it is drift. **The UFC decision rate moved 12.3
points across recent years** (55% in 2019, 44% so far in 2026), and a Platt
correction fitted on a validation slice whose actual rate was 47.9% still
predicted 47.7% on a block where it was 52.5%.

So the rule uses a **rolling 300-fight base-rate anchor**, frozen in
`distance_model.json`: the logit is shifted so the trailing window matches its
own observed rate. On the test block that moved predictions to 0.529 against
0.525 actual. Discrimination is unchanged (AUC .608 to .613) — this fixes the
level only.

## The frozen rule

    probability : hazard model P(decision), anchored to the trailing 300 fights
    venue       : Polymarket distance markets only (spread <= 6c, depth >= $250)
    bet when    : |anchored P(decision) - ask| > 0.05
    stake       : flat 1 unit
    success     : ROI > +2% over >= 200 settled bets

Both sides are permitted. There is no favourites-only restriction because the
favourite-longshot analysis was measured on sportsbook moneylines and does not
transfer to a prediction market.

## Pre-stated expectation: lower than when I proposed this

I suggested distance as "the one candidate genuinely worth testing" before
measuring it. Having measured it, two things are worse than implied.
Discrimination is weak — **AUC 0.608**, barely above the 0.6 that separates a
useful signal from a decorative one. And the base rate is unstable by 12
points, which is several times any edge we could plausibly claim, so an
apparent edge over a few months is at least as likely to be era drift as skill.

That is an argument for the anchor and for a long horizon, not for abandoning
the test. But the honest prior here is low, and lower than I first said.

## Prohibited

- Reading the rule's result before 200 settled bets
- Adjusting the 300-fight window or the 0.05 threshold after seeing prices
- Pooling Polymarket distance results with the sportsbook moneyline ledger
- Treating a positive result as established without checking whether the
  decision rate drifted in the same direction over the test window

# Addendum 10: the conditional base-rate panel (2026-09-20)

A display feature, not a hypothesis test — but it needs registering for a
different reason than the others. The danger is not false discovery, it is
**selective display**: with a dozen candidate conditions, showing whichever
looks strongest turns a lookup table into a machine for rendering noise
attractively.

So this fixes the DISPLAY LIST. The panel shows every condition below, always,
including the ones that turn out flat. A condition is never dropped for being
boring and never added for being interesting.

## What the panel is

For each condition: the base rate, the rate within each quartile, the lift,
n, and a 95% interval. Descriptive counts from the corpus, not model output.
Nothing here is a prediction; it is what happened in past fights that looked
like this one.

## Conditions, fixed now

Each is included because there is a stated mechanism, not because it measured
well. Five were run before this was written and are marked SEEN; they are
reported as exploratory and re-validated on the reserved holdout.

| # | condition | outcome | mechanism | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | own opponent-adjusted takedown rate, quartiles | lands a takedown | direct: the rate IS the propensity | SEEN (.238 to .630) |
| C2 | opponent's takedown defence, quartiles | lands a takedown | the thing standing in the way | SEEN (.495 to .386) |
| C3 | own knockdown rate, quartiles | scores a knockdown | direct | SEEN (.114 to .294) |
| C4 | combined knockdown rate, quartiles | ends inside distance | two heavy hitters end fights | SEEN (.410 to .588) |
| C5 | combined control share, quartiles | ends inside distance | grappling-heavy fights grind out | SEEN (.480 to .486, FLAT) |
| C6 | reach differential, quartiles | lands a takedown | shooting under a longer fighter | new |
| C7 | combined strike volume, quartiles | ends inside distance | pace as a proxy for damage | new |
| C8 | age differential, quartiles | ends inside distance | the older fighter as the one who breaks | new |
| C9 | combined submission-attempt rate, quartiles | goes the distance | grapplers hunting finishes | new |
| C10 | own clinch+ground strike share, quartiles | lands a takedown | position-dependent offense needs the takedown | new |

C5 stays in the panel precisely because it is flat. A conditional-rate display
that only ever shows strong relationships is indistinguishable from one that
selects them, and the reader has no way to tell. The null row is the evidence
that the list was fixed in advance.

## Display rules

- Every condition rendered, every quartile, always.
- n and a 95% interval on every cell. A quartile under 200 fights is greyed.
- Never ranked by lift, never truncated to "top" conditions.
- Labelled as historical frequencies, not predictions, and never combined into
  a single "regime" score. Compressing a dozen conditions into one bar means
  choosing which dominates, which is selection by another name.

## Explicitly NOT built

A "dominant fighting style" indicator tied to winning. Style features were
tested against the win model and came back at **-0.0009 log loss, 95% CI
[-0.0041, +0.0022]** (addendum, style cluster). Showing a style-to-wins bar
would have the site contradicting its own recorded result.

## Success criterion

There is none, because nothing is being claimed. The panel is correct if its
numbers match the corpus and the holdout reproduces the SEEN rows within their
intervals. If a SEEN row fails to reproduce, it is removed and the failure
recorded here.

# Addendum 11: scoring conventions borrowed from other combat sports (2026-09-20)

Registered before fitting. The question was whether wrestling, boxing, Muay
Thai or BJJ analytics offer anything retrofittable. Most of what those sports
use is either the same thing under another name (CompuBox punch counts are
UFCStats significant strikes) or needs data that does not exist here
(wrestling's scramble/transition models need positional tracking; boxing's
round-scoring models need the fight to have happened).

Two conventions ARE transferable, because both re-weight inputs we already
record rather than requiring new measurement.

| # | idea | source | predicted sign | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **damage-weighted striking**: head 1.0, body 0.6, leg 0.4, instead of counting every significant strike equally | boxing and Muay Thai both score effect over volume; a jab to the arm and a head kick are one strike each to UFCStats | positive | our striking differential treats a leg kick and a head strike identically, which no combat sport's scoring does |
| S2 | **active vs stalling control**: ground strikes landed per second of control time, and control differential weighted by it | IBJJF scores positional advance, not time held; judging distinguishes damage from stalling | positive | control time is currently one undifferentiated number, so a fighter smothering for four minutes scores the same as one passing and striking |

## Fixed weights, not fitted ones

S1's weights come from scoring convention, not from the corpus. Fitting them
would rediscover whatever the data already says and guarantee a fit — the
whole point is to test whether an *external* convention carries information
our equal-weight version misses.

## Analysis plan

Each metric replaces (not supplements) its equal-weight counterpart in the
frozen 14-feature win model — S1 swaps `d_adj_slpm`, S2 swaps `d_ctrl_share`
where it appears via `grapple_edge`. Both are also tested as additions. Window
2012 to 2026-03, walk-forward, bootstrap CI on the log-loss change.

Separately, both are tested against the **projection** targets (strike volume,
control time, takedown probability), because that is where style information
has previously helped and the win model has rejected everything.

Benjamini-Hochberg at FDR 0.10 across the family of four tests (2 metrics x
{win model, projections}).

## Pre-stated expectation

Low for the win model, higher for the projections. Eight families have now
come back null against the winner, including the style shares these weights
are built from. But style shares DID help projections (strike-volume ranking
Spearman .441 against .283), and S1/S2 are sharper versions of exactly that
information. If they land anywhere it is there.

## Addendum 11: RESULT (2026-09-20)

**Zero of four supported.** Nothing approaches the BH thresholds (.025 to .10).

### Win model

| test | accuracy | log loss | gain | 95% CI | P(better) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| frozen 14 | 67.54% | .6199 | — | — | — |
| S1 damage-weighted, added | 67.54% | .6198 | +0.0000 | [-0.0006, +0.0007] | .544 |
| S1 **swapped** for `d_adj_slpm` | 68.17% | .6216 | -0.0017 | [-0.0043, +0.0009] | .100 |
| S2 active control, added | 67.42% | .6203 | -0.0004 | [-0.0009, +0.0001] | .056 |
| both added | 67.54% | .6201 | -0.0003 | [-0.0010, +0.0005] | .260 |

The swap is the interesting row and a trap worth naming. Replacing equal-weight
striking with damage-weighted striking **raised accuracy to 68.17%**, the best
figure this model has produced — while log loss got *worse* (-0.0017, CI
crossing zero). Accuracy moved six correct calls out of 798; log loss says the
probabilities degraded. Reporting the accuracy alone would be the single most
misleading thing available in this dataset, which is why the pre-registered
metric is log loss.

### Projections

| target | base | with S1+S2 |
|---|---|---|
| strike volume | Spearman .3855 | .3922 |
| control time | Spearman .4394 | **.4477** (r2 .2334 to .2425) |
| takedown | AUC .7405 | .7372 |

Control time improves slightly and takedown gets slightly worse. Neither is
close to significant at these sample sizes, and two of three moving in
opposite directions is what noise looks like.

### Conclusion

Boxing and Muay Thai score effect over volume, and BJJ scores positional
advance over time held. Both conventions are real and both are sound reasoning
about the sport. Neither carries information beyond what equal-weight counting
already gives this model.

**Nine families now.** The consistent finding across all of them is that the
constraint is not how the inputs are weighted but how few fights each athlete
has: ~6.5 recorded bouts, one bit of outcome each. Re-weighting cannot create
information that was never recorded.

# Addendum 12: formulas borrowed from other fields (2026-09-20)

Registered before fitting. The request was to try every possible equation, and
the honest version of that is a fixed family tested together under correction
— testing fifty formulas at p < 0.05 and reporting the winners guarantees two
or three spurious "discoveries" by arithmetic alone.

Worth stating first: a gradient booster already represents every monotone
transform, threshold and interaction of these inputs simultaneously, and it
LOST to plain logistic regression. So the prior that some square root or
exponent unlocks the data is low. These are included anyway because each has a
specific structural reason from its own field.

| # | formula | field | form | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | log-ratio striking | finance (log returns) | log(slpm_a / slpm_b) | differences treat 1-vs-2 like 10-vs-11; ratios are scale-invariant |
| F2 | log-ratio takedowns | finance | log(td_a / td_b) | same, for the grappling axis |
| F3 | ape index | anthropometry | (reach - height)_a - (reach - height)_b | wingspan relative to frame, a real combat-sports measure we never built |
| F4 | performance volatility | finance (volatility) | sd of per-fight strike output, differenced | a consistent fighter and an erratic one can share a mean |
| F5 | Sharpe-style consistency | finance (Sharpe ratio) | mean output / sd output | return per unit of risk |
| F6 | method entropy | information theory | Shannon entropy of KO/SUB/DEC wins | a fighter who wins every way is harder to prepare for |
| F7 | Gompertz age decline | actuarial / biology | exp(0.09 x (age - 30)) | mortality risk rises exponentially with age; our strongest feature is entered linearly |
| F8 | sqrt experience | diminishing returns | sqrt(n_fights) | the 20th fight teaches less than the 2nd |
| F9 | kinetic power | physics (KE = mv^2) | kd15 x weight_index^2 | striking force should scale with mass |
| F10 | inverse-square reach | physics | sign(d) x d^2 | a reach edge may matter nonlinearly with distance |

Each added individually to the frozen 14. Benjamini-Hochberg at FDR 0.10
across all ten. Supported only if it survives correction AND improves log loss
out of sample. Accuracy is not a criterion — addendum 11 showed accuracy rising
while probabilities degraded.

F7 is the one with the strongest prior. Age is the single most important
feature in the model, and the Gompertz law is one of the best-replicated
regularities in biology. If decline really accelerates, a linear age term is
misspecified and this should show it.

## Addendum 12: RESULT (2026-09-20)

**Zero of ten supported.**

| formula | gain | 95% CI | p | BH |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| kinetic power (KE = mv^2) | **-0.0013** | [-0.0023, -0.0004] | .012 | .010 |
| Gompertz age | +0.0008 | [-0.0001, +0.0017] | .077 | .020 |
| Sharpe consistency | -0.0022 | [-0.0055, +0.0007] | .165 | .030 |
| method entropy | -0.0010 | [-0.0026, +0.0005] | .177 | .040 |
| sqrt experience | +0.0027 | [-0.0017, +0.0069] | .216 | .050 |
| volatility | -0.0023 | [-0.0061, +0.0016] | .232 | .060 |
| inverse-square reach | +0.0007 | [-0.0006, +0.0021] | .303 | .070 |
| log-ratio takedowns | +0.0007 | [-0.0013, +0.0026] | .501 | .080 |
| ape index | +0.0001 | [-0.0001, +0.0002] | .505 | .090 |
| log-ratio striking | +0.0000 | [-0.0001, +0.0002] | .645 | .100 |

Kinetic power is the instructive row: the **smallest p-value in the family and
a significantly NEGATIVE effect.** A "try every formula and keep what is
significant" search would have promoted a transform that makes predictions
worse. Gompertz, the strongest prior, points the right way and misses its
threshold.

# Addendum 13: the opening line, EXPLORATORY (2026-09-20)

**This is not a confirmatory result and must not be reported as one.** It was
found after, and because of, a descriptive observation, with thresholds chosen
on the same data. It is registered now, frozen, so that the forward ledger can
test it honestly.

## What prompted it

On 315 bouts with repeated snapshots, the closing line beats the opening line
substantially: log loss **0.5974 at open, 0.5670 at close**, AUC .7497 to .7781.
The market genuinely learns between open and close. Drift adds nothing BEYOND
the close (+0.0006, CI [-0.013, +0.013]), so there is no "follow the steam"
edge.

That reframes the question. The market beats the model at the close. It may
not at the OPEN.

## What was found

On 209 held-out bouts, model trained only on fights before 2025-03:

- correlation between (model minus opening price) and the subsequent line
  move: **Spearman +0.186, p = 0.007**; Pearson +0.134, p = 0.053
- where the model disagreed with the open by 8+ points (113 bouts), the line
  then moved toward the model **59.3%** of the time, against 50% for no skill
- betting the model's side at the open whenever it disagreed by 2+ points:
  183 bets, **mean CLV +1.21 points, 55.7% positive**

The interpretation, if it holds: the model is right but early. It reads the
same public statistics the market eventually prices, and the market takes
the week to get there. That is a coherent and well-documented pattern in
sports betting — opening lines are softer, and sharp money moves them.

## Why this is the most promising lead in the project, and why to distrust it

Promising, because it is the first result that points at a mechanism rather
than a coefficient, and positive CLV is the metric professional bettors
actually use. Every previous family tried to beat the close and failed. This
does not try to.

Distrusted, because: one exploratory analysis among many run today; thresholds
of 2 and 8 points chosen on this data; 209 bouts is small; and the p-value
does not survive any honest accounting of how many analyses preceded it.

## The frozen rule, for forward testing only

    model      : the frozen 14-feature win model
    price      : the FIRST capture in the ledger for each bout (proxy for open)
    bet when   : |model - open| >= 0.02, on the model's side
    metric     : CLV = closing price - price at first capture, on the backed side
    success    : mean CLV > 0 with a 95% interval excluding zero, n >= 150 bets

The ledger already records multiple snapshots per bout, so no new capture
code is needed — only the rule applied to rows it is already writing.

## Prohibited

- Reporting the 1.21-point figure as an edge. It is a hypothesis.
- Tuning the 2-point threshold on forward data.
- Combining this with the residual-rule ledger; they test different claims.

## Addendum 10: display revision (2026-09-21)

Layout only; no condition added, dropped, reordered or re-measured.

The panel was first drawn one card per condition with the OUTCOME as each
card's heading, so "Lands a takedown" appeared four times and "Ends inside the
distance" four times, reading as different things. It is now grouped by
outcome — takedown (C1, C2, C6, C10), knockdown (C3), finish (C4, C5, C7, C8,
C9) — one row per registered condition, in registered order within each group.

C9 was registered against "goes the distance", which is exactly one minus
"ends inside the distance". It is displayed as its complement so the finish
question has one home. Every cell is the same data inverted; significance and
intervals are unchanged. The underlying `site/baserates.json` still records it
as registered.

Rows are labelled "clear pattern" (3-4 quarters differ from the base rate),
"weak pattern" (1-2) or "no pattern" (0). That is a description of the
significance counts already computed, not a new threshold, and flat rows are
still shown.

# Addendum 14: the opponent's side, and simple formulas per prop (2026-09-21)

Registered before measuring.

## C11 and C12: the knockdown question had only one side

Takedowns are shown from both corners — the fighter's rate and the defence in
front of him. Knockdowns were shown from one. The knockdown projection already
uses the opponent's durability (`opp_kd_against15`, `opp_sapm`,
`opp_str_def`); the panel simply never displayed it.

| # | condition | outcome | mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| C11 | opponent's knockdowns absorbed per 15 min | scores a knockdown | a chin that has gone before goes again |
| C12 | opponent's strikes absorbed per minute | scores a knockdown | a hittable opponent gets hit cleanly more often |

Added to the fixed display list under the same rules as addendum 10: always
shown, flat or not.

## Can a short formula replace the gradient booster for each prop?

The panel is a one-variable-at-a-time model. The projection models are the
many-variable version of the same thing. If a logistic regression on only the
registered conditions for a prop matches the booster, the site can show the
formula itself — "this number comes from his takedown rate and the defence in
front of him" — which is exactly the checkable-service goal.

    takedown   F-TD : own_adj_td15, opp_td_def, reach_diff, own_clinch+ground
    knockdown  F-KD : own_kd15, opp_kd_against15, opp_sapm

Compared against the current booster on the same held-out fighter-fights.
Brier, AUC and calibration, with a bootstrap interval on the Brier difference.

**Decision rule, fixed now:** if the formula's Brier is within 0.002 of the
booster's (or better), the site adopts the formula for that prop, because a
number a reader can verify is worth more than a marginally sharper one they
cannot. If it is worse by more than 0.002, the booster stays.

Pre-stated expectation: close for takedowns, where one input dominates;
further for knockdowns, where the booster may be using interactions.

## Addendum 14: RESULT (2026-09-21)

### C11, C12

| condition | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C11 opponent's knockdowns absorbed | 14% | 18% | 22% | 24% | clear pattern |
| C12 opponent's strikes absorbed | 18% | 21% | 19% | 20% | no pattern |

The chin carries information; volume absorbed does not. Being hit a lot does
not predict being knocked down — having been knocked down does. Both rows now
render in the knockdown group, C12 dimmed as flat.

### Formula vs booster — and a comparison error caught before acting

The first comparison used a less regularised booster than production and
showed the knockdown formula clearly ahead (-0.0055, CI excluding zero). Re-run
against the **exact production settings**, the gap closed to a tie. The
decision was made on the fair comparison:

| prop | production booster | formula | difference | CI | decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| takedown (4 inputs) | .2008, AUC .742, slope 1.01 | .2109, AUC .723 | +0.0102 | [+0.0038, +0.0161] | **keep booster** |
| knockdown (3 inputs) | .1445, AUC .668, slope 0.76 | .1432, AUC .668 | -0.0012 | [-0.0050, +0.0025] | **adopt formula** |

Knockdowns: statistically indistinguishable, identical AUC, and the booster's
calibration slope of 0.76 says it was overconfident at the top (said 47%,
happened 41%). Under the fixed rule the formula wins the tie. Fitted weights:
**+0.38 x own knockdown rate, +0.23 x opponent's knockdowns absorbed, -0.01 x
opponent's strikes absorbed**, per standard deviation.

Takedowns: the booster is genuinely better and near-perfectly calibrated
(slope 1.01). Four clear single-variable patterns do not add up to a good
formula, because they overlap — a strong wrestler tends to have both a high
takedown rate and a high clinch share — and the booster models that overlap.

So "a formula per prop" is the right question, answered one prop at a time:
sometimes the short version is as good and should ship because it can be
checked, and sometimes it is not.

---

# Addendum 15: a short formula for "ends inside the distance" (2026-09-21)

Registered before measuring, same rule as addendum 14.

## Formula

    F-ITD : C4 combined knockdown rate, C5 combined control share,
            C7 combined striking pace, C8 age gap, C9 combined submission
            attempts, + scheduled rounds (3 or 5)

Scheduled rounds is not one of the registered conditions; it is included
because it is structural, not a pattern — a five-round fight has two more
rounds in which to end, and any honest finish formula has to know that. It is
declared here so it is not an after-the-fact addition.

## Comparison

Against the production competing-risks model's P(finish) = 1 - P(decision),
trained, hazard-calibrated and tested on the same split it uses in production.
Brier, AUC and calibration slope on the same held-out fights, bootstrap
interval on the Brier difference. Both compared raw; the level drift noted in
addendum 9 affects both equally and is not corrected for either.

## Decision rule, fixed now

Formula adopted if its Brier is within 0.002 of the survival model's, or
better.

## How a win would be applied, fixed now

The survival model's outputs must keep summing to 100%. So the formula would
set only the LEVEL: P(finish) comes from the formula, and the survival model's
split of that finish across method and round is kept and rescaled to it.

    P(method m, round r) = P_formula(finish) x P_survival(m, r | finish)

Round and method probabilities stay coherent; only how likely a finish is at
all changes.

## Pre-stated expectation

Survival model favoured. It sees the full 14-feature fighter comparison and
models time directly; the formula sees five sums, three of which measured flat
in the base-rate panel. A tie would be a surprise.

## Addendum 15: RESULT (2026-09-21)

**Formula adopted, and against the pre-stated expectation.**

| | Brier | AUC | calibration slope | mean said |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| survival model P(finish) | .2487 | .608 | **0.42** | 51.3% |
| 6-input formula | **.2420** | .598 | 0.94 | 47.4% |

Held out: 812 fights, actual finish rate 47.5%. Difference -0.0068, 95% CI
[-0.0164, +0.0030]; within the 0.002 rule, so adopted.

The finding underneath matters more than the swap: **the survival model's
finish probabilities were badly overconfident.** Fights it put at 74% finished
60% of the time; at 55%, 45%. It ranks fights marginally better (AUC .608 vs
.598) but spreads them far too wide. The formula's bands line up within about a
point everywhere. Every "ends inside the distance", round and totals number the
site had shown inherited that overconfidence.

Weights: +0.31 combined knockdown rate, +0.21 combined submission attempts,
+0.12 five rounds, -0.09 pace, +0.04 age gap, -0.01 control. Consistent with the
base-rate panel: the two rows with a pattern carry the formula, the three flat
rows carry almost nothing.

Applied as registered. The formula sets P(finish); the survival model's split
across method, round and time is rescaled to it. Checked on the live card:
methods, rounds and finish sum identically on every bout, and round totals
remain monotone.

### Consequences for other records

- Addendum 9's frozen distance rule is defined on the hazard model's P(decision)
  with a rolling anchor. It is unaffected: the forward test keeps its
  registered probability; only the displayed number changed.
- From 2026-09-21, scorecard claims for inside-the-distance, decision, method,
  round and totals are the rescaled numbers. Earlier logged claims are from the
  raw survival model. The switch date separates them.
