"""Competing-risks hazard model: one structure, every outcome.

The props in `props.py` are independent binary classifiers. P(KO), P(decision)
and P(over 2.5 rounds) are fitted separately, so nothing forces them to agree —
they can imply a method distribution that does not sum to one, or a round line
inconsistent with the finish probability. That is a modeling error even when
each individual number is fine.

A fight ending is really a race between hazards: A can stop B, B can stop A,
either can submit the other, and the clock runs out on all of it. Modeled as
competing risks in discrete time, one fit produces a coherent joint
distribution and everything else is arithmetic on it:

    P(method), P(ends in round N), P(goes the distance),
    P(fighter X wins by method M in round N), expected duration,
    and P(X wins) as the sum over all the ways X can win.

Structure. Each fight is expanded into one row per minute it survives. In each
interval the outcome is one of five classes:

    0 survive   1 A by KO   2 B by KO   3 A by submission   4 B by submission

A decision is not a class — it is what happens when the fight survives every
scheduled interval, so it falls out of the survival curve rather than being
predicted directly. Fights are censored at their OWN scheduled length (25
minutes for five-rounders, 15 for three), which is why `sched_sec` exists.

Antisymmetry is preserved the same way as in the win model: every fight is
expanded in both orientations, with the A/B classes swapped, so the model
cannot learn a corner bias and P(A by KO) in one orientation equals P(B by KO)
in the other.

Given the distance, who wins is a separate question — judges score what
happened, which this model does not observe — so P(A | decision) is a small
second model on the same pre-fight features.

    like the likeliest decision on the card. That inverts the model — it scored
